I drew these patterns in Illustrator using a Wacom tablet. This was a really fun blend of doodling and digital art! 

I was inspired by dark, earthtone paisleys I saw on clothing growing up for my first pattern.

I reused some of the same elements in my second pattern, and tried to incorporate each of the plants I have in my bedroom right now!
